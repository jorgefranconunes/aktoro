= Setting up the development environment

== Introduction

This document describes the steps for seting up the development
environment for the Aktoro project. The information contained here is
targeted at developers of the Aktoro project itself.

The instructions in this document assume a Linux environment, or
Windows with Cygwin installed.





== Requirements

The following packages are required for developing in the Aktoro
project:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle
  JDK 8]

You will need to have the above packages installed in your
workstation.

In addition to the above, some other tools are also required. Those
tools are available from specific platform packages. Depending on
platform, you will need to install the packages mentioned on the table
below.

[options="header"]
|====
| Platform | Packages
| CentOS |
  `gnupg2`

  `libxslt`

| Ubuntu |
  `gnupg`

  `xsltproc`

| Cygwin |
  `libxslt`

|====





== Fetch source tree

To fetch the project source tree do the following:

[source,sh]
----
git clone git@github.com:jorgefranconunes/aktoro.git
----

After executing the above (and after a few moments) a directory named
`aktoro` will have been created in your current working
directory. That `aktoro` directory contains the project tree, and will
be your working area.





== Edit/compile/run cycle

To perform a full build, just run the Gradle wrapper in the `modules`
directory:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew build
----

By default integration tests are no run. When you want to run the
integration tests with the build do the following:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew -P aktoro.integrationTest build
----

In this section, and in the following sections, the examples with the
command for executing the Gradle wrapper (`./modules/gradlew`) assume
the current working directory is the project top directory. In fact,
you can run the `gradlew` command from any directory, and it will work
as intended.





== Running unit tests

To run all unit tests:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew test
----

To force the unit tests to be run again:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew cleanTest test
----

To run a single unit test suite execute the following from the command
line:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew cleanTest test --tests \*.ActorRefImplTest
----

Of course, you can change the `ActorRefImplTest` above with the test
suite you actually want to run.  By convention classes containing
integration tests test suites have names ending in `Test`.

And to run one single unit test:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew cleanTest test \
    --tests \*.ActorRefImplTest.whenVoidMethodInvoked_thenCoreMethodIsExecuted
----





== Running integration tests

To run all integration tests:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew integrationTest
----

To force the integration tests to be run again:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew cleanIntegrationTest integrationTest
----

Running just one single integration test suite, or one single
integraton test is the exact same procedure as for unit tests. By
convention classes containing integration tests test suites have names
ending in `IT`.





== Installing project JARs into local Maven repository

Sometimes it is usefull to install SNAPSHOT versions of the project
JARs into the local Maven repository. This allows for local testing of
a modified Aktoro build within another project.

To install the project JARs into the local Maven repository (typically
`~/.m2/repository`) do the following:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew mavenInstall
----





== Code quality reports

To generate static analysis and test code coverage reports do the
following:

[source,sh]
----
./modules/gradlew buildReports
----


*THE INFORMATION IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION IS NOT YET VALID.*

To generate static analysis and test code coverage reports do the
following:

[source,sh]
----
./devtools/bin/build-bundle --with-reports
----

This will create under directory `./target/CodeQualityReports` a set
of HTML pages with the results of static analysis (Checkstyle,
Findbugs, PMD) and test code coverage (Jacoco). The entry page will be
at `./target/CodeQualityReports/index.html`.





== Creating a new release

*THE INFORMATION IN THIS SECTION IS NOT YET VALID.*

To generate the tarball for an engineering build do the following:

----
./devtools/bin/build-bundle
----

The above will perform a full build and create a tarball named
`aktoro-{latestAktoroVersion}-yyyyMMddhhmm.tar.bz2` at the top of the
working area.

To generate an official release see the instructions at
link:CreatingRelease.html[Creating a release of the Aktoro software].
